description: In 1873, Henry Scadding, former rector of Toronto's Church of the Holy
  Trinity, wrote the definitive history of early Toronto. His detailed portrait of

  Armstrong is shorter than the original, with Scadding's references to outside cities
  and characters shortened or omitted to give the book a sharper focus on Toronto.
  This second edition is an updated and.
